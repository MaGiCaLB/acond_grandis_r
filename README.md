# Home Assistant integration of the ACOND Grandis R heatpump
## Using TADO to control the heatpump actions

This is my integration of the ACOND Grandis R (Which is different from the ACOND PRO R)
Using current integrations within Home Assistant it is quite possible to add the heatpump.

To make things a bit more interesting, I decided to keep using TADO in our house.
As we have a large house with different rooms, they all require different temperature settings.
To adjust the settings we use the TADO automatic scheduling for temperatures.

## Modbus integration

## Tado integration enabled scheduling
